        "What is the most representative value of their weekly sales, and why?\n",
        "     - The most representative value of their weekly sales is 12, because the Mean(Average) is 12.43 which is around 12 so the mean is 12, the Median is also 12 because the middle value of data is 12, the Mode(most frequent value) is also 12, as it appears twice.\n",

        "    - First calculate the sum of scores, 12+15+14+16+18+20+19=114, then count the total number of scores, number of scores(n)= 7, then calculate the mean score by using the mean formula which is [Mean=sum of scores divided by number of scores(n)]= 16.29, the mean scores indicate that the average performance of the class, a mean score is approximately 16.29 out of 20, which shows the students performed well in short quiz.\n",

        "     - According to the given data set the mode is 8, because 8 appears three times in the given data set which is more than any other number in the given data set, this information is useful for the store manager because it shows the most popular shoe size sold, it is useful to the manager, manager can use this data(mode) to make sure the store has a sufficient stock of size 8 shoes to fulfill the customers demand.\n",

        "Why is the median a better measure than the mean in this case? Calculate the median.\n",
        "     - The median is a better measures in this case because the data contains exception, the mean(average) is very much affect by this maximum value, pulling it aside from the typical price range of the majority of the cars, Median is $10200, because it is in the middle of the data, we can also calculate the median position or value by using median formula which is [median position=N+1 divided by 2] = 3rd position which is $10200.\n",

        "     - To find the range, first we have to identify the maximum value and minimum value in the given data set, the maximum value is 120 and minimum value is 98, the range is the difference between the maximum value and minimum value, [Range=Maximum-Minimum] after using the range formula the range is 22, therefore the the range of the weekly weight of harvested apples is 22kg, the range indicates the variability in the weekly harvest, this helps the farmer in planning his packaging by showing the difference between his best harvest weeks and worst harvest weeks, Plan for packaging needs by making sure enough materials are available to control the maximum amount harvested.\n",

        "     - Company A is more consistent because it has lower Variance, Variance is a measure of how extend out a set of data points is from it's mean(average), a lower Variance shows that the data points are grouped  or packed more closely around the average, since there is less variability or change or instability in the delivery delays.\n",

        "     - Standard deviation is a statistical measure that shows how much the daily prices of an investment vary from the average price, a higher standard deviation means the price fluctuates more significantly indicating higher risk, a lower standard deviation means the price is more stable indicating lower risk, Coin B has a standard deviation of $120, which is much higher coin A whose standard deviation is $30, therefore, Coin B is riskier to invest.\n",

        "      - According to the given data first calculate the mean(average) by using the formula which is [Mean=sum of all observation divided by number of observation(n)] after applying the formula the mean is 414 KWh, then we have to find the squared deviations from the mean: (400-414)²=196, (420-414)²=36, (390-414)²=576, (450-414)²=1296, (410-414)²=16, then we add the squared deviations whose sum is 2120, then we have to calculate the standard deviation by using the formula which is [s=square root (xi-x̌)² divided by (n-1)] , then the result is 23.02 KWh, the mean(414KWh) provides the central or typical monthly energy consumption for this family, the standard deviation which is approx 23.02 KWh is a measure of the data's variability or spread around that mean, relatively low standard deviation compared to the mean indicates that the monthly usage values are tightly grouped around the average, this tells us the family's energy consumption pattern is stable and consistent from month to month, without extreme peaks or troughs, he family's mean electricity usage is 414 kWK and the sample standard deviation is approximately 23.02 kWh  values indicate the family's energy use is relatively consistent and predictable, floating losely around the average, with minimal monthly variation.\n",
